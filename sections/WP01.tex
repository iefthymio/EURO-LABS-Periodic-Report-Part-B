The participants were given support for the project's implementation, specifically in TNAs and financial aspects, through constant contacts and daily helpdesk via email, telephone and remote meetings.
All the Deliverables and Milestones have been monitored and reported. Reports are available on the F\&T portal and, when public, also through the Zenodo repository and linked to the project website.

The meetings of the Steering Committee/ Management Team were held on a regular basis, usually bi-monthly.
Also periodic management meetings of the Project Office staff were held, involving people from INFN Bologna, INFN Frascati and CERN.
Two annual meetings were held in the period: 
SAM was organized by IFJ-PAN and held in Krakow, Poland (9th-11th October 2023, https://agenda.infn.it/event/34651/). It was attended by 83 participants.
TAM was organized by and held at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland (28th-30th October 2024, https://indico.cern.ch/event/1370378/), 85 participants.
Through a dense agenda of interventions, the three scientific communities have shared their experiences on TNAs and other activities. During the annual meetings, very appreciated guided tours were also organized to IFJ-PAN and CERN facilities. 
Two Governing Board meetings were held during the annual meetings (respectively, 11th Oct. 2023 and 29th Oct. 2024. They were actively attended. During the 2024 GB meeting, the Chairperson's mandate was renewed and the procedure for budget transfers between beneficiaries was approved.
