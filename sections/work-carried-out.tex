\section{Explanation of the Work carried out by the Beneficiaries and Overview of the Progress}
\label{sec:work-carried-out}

\acrshort{euro-labs} is a pioneering project in Europe to build the foundations for creating synergies and collaborations between the \acrfull{RI} of the Nuclear and High Energy communities. This endeavor will enhance Europe's potential for successfully facing the upcoming new challenges in the coming decades. EURO-LABS was the response to a challenge given by Horizon Europe to build one super community of subatomic researchers, exchanging expertise and working practices among researchers and associated technical staff in Europe. The three communities are those engaged in Nuclear Physics and accelerator/detector technology for High Energy Physics, involved in curiosity-driven research and its technical and societal offshoots. The key objective of EURO-LABS is to promote and facilitate access to improved available resources at a major fraction of \acrlong{euro-labs} with an emphasis on young students or early-career researchers. Various service improvements planned at these facilities will further improve the level of the available infrastructures. 

The large and diverse community of users have access to a panorama of facilities, where they can choose the most appropriate state-of-the-art RI(s), with expert support, among 47 facilities, varying from modest to large ESFRI facilities spread over 12 countries. Within EURO-LABS a broad and focused joint training activity, including hands-on experience at the RI’s, is also offered. Special attention is paid to attracting new users' communities, outside the nuclear and particle physics communities. This is very important to develop diverse skills of the next generation researchers, for the optimal exploitation of the substantial number of RIs for scientific and technological discoveries and beyond. 

The project is divided into five \acrfull{WP}s. The first one deals with project management and coordination. Three work packages deal with the utilization of a variety of accelerators having a very wide range of characteristics, from Nuclear Physics (and a virtual computing facility for planning and interpreting experimental data) infrastructures to RIs for Accelerator and Detector R\&D. The last WP deals with Open Diverse and Inclusive Science, including development of machine learning techniques, promotion of FAIR principles and training.  The project activities funded by EURO-LABS cover a broad range of science and technology: from creating for the first time in the laboratory intergalactic conditions, to characterizing the isomer of 229Th and its potential use as nuclear clock (towards a most stable clock ever).Tests of innovative equipment for FLASH radiation therapy along with very sensitive measurements,  or ideas of using an Atomic Mass Spectrometer, for tracing radioactive elements in the North Sea, are a few highlights among the achievements during this Reporting Period - P1.

For optimum management of EURO-LABS, the Project Office (PO) consists of members from INFN Bologna, including one full-time expert support staff for daily operations and planning, along with members from INFN Frascati and CERN EU office (lending their expertise when additional help is required for more specialized tasks). Administrative actions in P1 included the distribution of the EC pre-financing and related monitoring of resource utilization and clarification procedures. The Steering Committee (SC) and the Management Team (MT) meet regularly and ensure the smooth running of the technical part and the related administration of the project. A kick-off meeting of the project was held in Bologna, a month after the official start of the project. The Governing Board (GB) met for the first time on that occasion. A website (https://web.infn.it/EURO-LABS/) was created and provides all information about the project, including the gateway to access to the wide range of facilities in EURO-LABS. current events, employment etc.

A short description of the main goals of the project, as well as of the specific objectives of each WP is given below (subsection 1.1), together with a brief summary of the progress achieved in P1 towards these objectives. A more detailed explanation of the activities carried out in P1 is provided in subsection 1.2. 

The project provides transnational access to a large number of Laboratories for Accelerator Based Sciences to users for conducting state-of-art-research.  These facilities both EU and facilities outside Europe are subject to radiation protection legislation, in addition to their national legislations. These are followed by all these facilities.  One of the tasks in the project involves the use of Machine Learning (ML) methods to improve beam quality, transport efficiency and accelerator reproducibility reducing the time for beam tuning. The work developed in P1 using ML methods consistent with the ethical principles and requirements in accordance with the Ethic by design approach in all the design, acquisition, implementation and monitoring phases as mentioned in the ethics report (D6.1).

This section summarises the work carried out by the \acrshort{euro-labs} consortium during the \nth{0} \acrshort{RP} towards the project goals and work plan as described in the \acrfull{GA} \cite{bib:grantagreement2020}. 

\subsection{Objectives}

The main goals of the project as described in section 1.1 of the Declaration of Actions (DoA) are listed below: 
\begin{tcolorbox}[myliststyle]
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}, nosep, left=0pt]
    \item Setup simplified and more efficient access procedures to an enlarged and diverse portfolio of leading RIs and installations located across Europe, to offer dedicated beam-time attributed to EURO-LABS, at no cost to the users, primarily for conducting research in Nuclear and High-Energy Physics. These RIs, potentially also attractive to related disciplines are expected to fertilize synergies and activities related to applications via a wider sharing of information, knowledge and technologies across scientific fields.
    \item Organize and facilitate the effective use of the RIs by providing expert help to visiting teams, to optimally plan and exploit the full capabilities of the facilities for cutting-edge research. Create reference documentation and publicise the specifications and features of each RI along with examples of some key experiments or tests that can be conducted. This will allow research teams to choose the best RI (RIs) for their investigations
    \item Additionally conduct collaborative targeted improvements for the existing services that will lead to an increase of the scientific and technical opportunities at various RIs.
    \item Make the results from the tests conducted at the RIs of EURO-LABS during the period of the project freely available to the scientific community and manage the experimental data, when relevant, through a Data Management Plan (DMP) in line with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
    \item Organize the training of the new generation of researchers and young technical staff to best exploit the RIs, through workshops and hands-on experience at specifically chosen RIs.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

In pursuit of these overarching goals, specific objectives have been defined for each WP for P1. A summary of the progress towards these objectives is provided below.

\tsubsubsection{WP1 - Management}

The administrative management of the EURO-LABS is carried out by the Project office (PO) The management of the project is done along with the Management team (MT) and the Steering Committee (SC). It report to the Governing board and the laisses with EU Project officer.The specific objectives include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item financial follow-up include of resource utilisation, cost reporting and collection, reviews,
    \item submission of the Financial Statements of all beneficiaries, as well as the distribution and payments of the EU funding,
    \item monitor, review and release of the Deliverables and Milestones reports,
    \item provide periodically relevant information to the beneficiaries,
    \item implement strategic issues, such as modifications of the project programme of work, and admission of new beneficiaries as decided by the GB,
    \item announce and provide the relevant instruction of all the possibilities   proposed by the various research infrastructures of EURO-LAB for transnational access and job opening available in the project.
\end{itemize}

\tsubsubsection{WP2 - Access to RI for Physics}

WP2 provides Transnational Access (TA) to fourteen (14) RIs for fundamental and applied nuclear physics experiments and to two (2) facilities providing TA and Virtual Access (VA) for related theoretical support. 
The specific objectives for P1 included: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item provision of TA at European accelerator facilities offering a stable or radioactive ion or neutron beams,
    \item create synergies between theory and experiments through TA offered at the ECT* (European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas (ECT*) and VA through the newly founded Theo4Exp facility,
    \item improve the services offered to users at several RIs.
\end{itemize}

In P2, all WP2 TA facilities have been very successful in achieving the objective of promoting and facilitating access to the users. Overall, approximately 78\% of the total number of Access Units (AU – beam hours) promised in the GA were provided in P2 of the project. Thus, it can be deduced that from the beginning of the project an average of around 130\% of the promised AUs have been delivered. The costs of these additional beam hours were covered by the local budget of the facilities. The distribution of the access units for each TA facility: declared for the whole project, provided in P2 and provided since beginning of the project, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:WP2_AU_statistics}.

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{graphics/WP2_AU_statistics.png}
    \caption{WP2 Access Units distribution.}
    \label{fig:WP2_AU_statistics}
\end{figure}

Also in P2, around 188 TA projects were supported: 80 projects in Task 2.1 (Stable ion beams), 86 projects in Task 2.2 (Radioactive Ion beams), 11 projects in Task 2.3 (Neutron beams) and 11 projects for the TA access to the theory center ECT* (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:WP2_projects}).  In addition, in P2, the facilities have exhausted 28\% of the allocated Travel and Subsistence (T\&S) funding, supporting traveling expenses and visits of 836 users (including approximately 30\% of female scientists) to prepare and develop instrumentation prior to the actual delivery of the beam, to run the experiments, or visit the theory center ECT*. Details are shown in the Figs.~\ref{fig:WP2_users_per_country} and~\ref{fig:WP2_users_men_women}.

    \caption{WP2 Female vs. male distribution of users.}
    \label{fig:WP2_users_men_women}
\end{figure}

Progress towards complementary use of different installations is evidenced, for example, the studies of the Pygmy Dipole Resonances in Ni isotopes, which were carried out by the same user group in two EURO-LABS TA facilities: NLC-CCB (Krakow) and IFIN-HH (Bucharest). The group exploited the specificity of each installation, to achieve a comprehensive understanding of temperature dependence of the PDR. 

The planned activities in P2 of Service Improvement, related to streamlined and remote access, targets for high intense beams, biomedical applications, improving ion beam services and optimal employment of traveling gamma-ray detectors, have been progressing well. The synergy between theory and experiments has been secured by the TA offered at the ECT* center, where 11 events were organized, aimed at microscopic optical potentials, strangeness reactions, nuclear theory and reactions for astrophysics, hadron tomography, the QCD phase diagram, QCD plasma, neutrino interactions, electric dipole moments, high-power lasers, and machine learning. Moreover, the new facility offering VA to theoretical tools accessible via user-friendly web pages to prepare and interpret experiments (Theo4Exp) has been successfully installed and started delivering access.
 
\tsubsubsection{WP3 - Access to RI for Accelerators}
WP3 is connected to the provision of TA to RIs related primarily to High Energy Accelerator R\&D. The WP groups fourteen (14) facilities located in eleven (11) research laboratories, spread out across Europe. The facilities are grouped into four Tasks, targeted to specific areas of R\&D: material testing, technology infrastructures, electron and laser beams, and applications. 
The key objective during this startup year defined by specific project milestones (MS17 and MS19), were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item to start-up the WP and Task level structures to accept TA requests and receive the first groups
    \item define the budget and timeline for the proposed service improvements, planned in seven (7) of the facilities.
\end{itemize}
Significant and tangible progress was achieved in working towards both objectives during the reference period with the two milestones achieved. 

The User Selection Panels (USP) per Task have been established, involving external experts at 50\% level, all willing to help us with the evaluation of the submitted proposals. As described in MS17 document, the startup schedule to receive projects and users in all facilities is confirmed and is according to plan. Note that not all facilities in WP3 were expected to be ready in P1, due to ongoing technical or upgrade work. Overall, approximately 12\% of the total AU for the duration of the project were delivered. However large variations among facilities observed as expected for this startup year. The technical specifications and resource planning for the proposed service improvements in few of the facilities was defined, with the implementation gradually starting from the end of this period and mainly to the following one. Highlights of the completed projects in the WP3 facilities during P1 are described in the following sections of this report.

\tsubsubsection{WP4 - Access to RI for Detectors}

WP4 serves to provide TA to top level European RIs for R\&D on High-Energy Physics (HEP) detectors. Transnational access to RIs is well tailored, in terms of freely available resources at facilities, to the needs of detector R\&D where dedicated funding is often a problem. The slate of RIs is chosen to match the needs of European (and wider) detector R\&D carried out in the framework of DRD collaborations, set up by ECFA, and soon monitored by DRDC. The access is spread over three (3) types of research infrastructures, grouped into tasks: test teams (3 facilities), detector characterization (2 facilities), and irradiations (6 facilities). Service Improvements (4th task) are planned at each RI to improve user access.

The key objective of WP4 in P1 was getting the TA framework running and executing user projects of high relevance to the detector R\&D community. While the success was not entirely uniform across RIs, the 63 projects, executed in P1, served more than 200 users and consumed already 42\% of the total access unit allocation. The USP common to all WP4 RIs was set up swiftly and accepted TA project applications with a high success rate due to careful pre-evaluation by the Facility Coordinators. With the commitment of the RIs, which spent most of their access allocation in P1, to provide additional resources, the RIs of WP4 are on course to facilitate Detector R\&D in HEP during the four years of the EURO-LABS project.

\tsubsubsection{WP5 - Open Diverse and Inclusive Science}

For WP5, the specific objectives for P1 are: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item foster the user diversity by engaging people of different nationalities, gender, age and level of expertise,
    \item enhance communication on project opportunities and dissemination of the project results,
    \item promote and accelerate the development of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable Reusable) research data management practices within the scientific community,
    \item develop tools using machine learning for accelerator control,
    \item enhance the competitiveness of our research infrastructure and its technical capabilities, using machine learning techniques and organizing hands-on schools
\end{itemize}

In the second year, progress has been made on all the points indicated above. In order to advertise EURO-LABS and disseminate its activities, a webpage was built, and two articles have been published in dissemination magazines of our domain: CERN Courier and Nuclear Physics News. To advertise our facilities, videos are shot and fourteen (14) are already available. The project DMP, as well as an authentication and authorization service for the community have been released. The machine learning GeOFF tool developed at CERN (Switzerland) has been adapted and used successfully at GSI (Germany). The preparations to use Geoff at CEA are ongoing. The training Scientific Board was selected and met several times. The hand-on schools at the basic and advanced level were planned
