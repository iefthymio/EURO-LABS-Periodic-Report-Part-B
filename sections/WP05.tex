\subsubsection*{Progress per Task}
\subparagraph{Task 5.1: Diversity \& Dissemination\\}
% \mbox{}

The task 5.1 deals with Diversity \& Dissemination.
The main objectives of this task focus on:
a) ensuring a large diversity, through a strong effort in engaging people of different nationalities, gender, age, and level of professional expertise (see the description in the core project activities sections) . To this aim, suitable criteria are practised for supporting users exploiting a given facility. Similarly, suitable criteria are also applied in the selection of participants in the schools organised by EURO-LABS. At every annual meeting of EURO-LABS, a diversity reported is presented and monitored so as to take possible corrective action to maximize diversity.

b) dissemination of activities and results of EURO-LABS through several key communication tools:

\textbf{Website:}
The EURO-LABS website was launched in October 2022. It can be found at the following address: \url{https://web.infn.it/EURO-LABS/}. In accordance with the recommendations of the previous review, the site is continuously being improved so as to increase the impact of the project.

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{graphics/Newletter_figure.png}
    \caption{The figure shows the cover of the three Newsletters produced so far.
}
    \label{fig:Newletter_figure}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Newsletters:} 
A biannual newsletter has been started, so far 3 issues have been published, see Fig.~\ref{fig:Newletter_figure}. The newsletter features a variety of topics: scientific, technical and news items about past activities, and information about planned future activities. It is written in such a way that the articles can be appreciated by a wide audience and thus publicize the broad range of activities of the EURO-LABS community. The next issue  is scheduled for June 2025. 
They are available on the website \url{https://web.infn.it/EUROLABS/category/news/newsletter/} and sent to the project's general mailing list and to everyone who has registered through the site
\url{https://web.infn.it/EURO-LABS/register_form/}, and to other interested parties.

\textbf{Videos of the facilities of EURO-LABS:}  
All the videos of the 39 Research Infrastructures (RIs) have been produced by the INFN Multimedia Group, in collaboration with the local staff of the various facilities. These videos are stored in the INFN repository \url{https://mediawall.infn.it/cat/euro-labs}. They are also available through the EURO-LABS website, both in the Media section (\url{https://web.infn.it/EURO-LABS/media/}) and on the YouTube channel 

(\url{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYQjjFQsooc45JqqfXHJiPCyN2wz9NhUp}).
 
The video of each facility is also directly linked on the TA pages of the website, to give the maximum information to current and potential users:

\textbf{Access for Physics} \url{https://web.infn.it/EURO-LABS/wp2-nuclear-physics-infrastructures/}

\textbf{Access for accelerators} \url{https://web.infn.it/EURO-LABS/wp3-ta-for-accelerators/},

\textbf{Access for detectors} \url{https://web.infn.it/EURO-LABS/wp4-ta-for-detectors/}.

The videos are also used in dissemination/communication related activities organized by the  EURO-LABS partners and available on their websites.

\textbf{Social Media activities for EURO-LABS}

As part of our outreach and dissemination strategy, EURO-LABS has been increasing its engagement with the scientific community and interested public through social media platforms, particularly LinkedIn and Instagram. Based on the advices provided after the first review of the project, social media accounts were started and are active since the end of 2024.

The primary objectives of EURO-LABS' social media activities are to further increase the visibility and awareness of the project's goals and achievements, foster engagement and interaction with the scientific community and the general public, disseminate information about project milestones, events, and research outcomes, and promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among researchers and institutions.
  
For our social media strategy, an editorial plan is defined on a three-months basis, serving as driving document for the posts to be put up. The first plan has already been made. The forthcoming editorial plans for LinkedIn are interconnected posts concerning various aspects of the project. This will include the presentation of the project, background articles, video interviews with project leaders, and highlights of partner organizations, together with posts to share results and outlining future plans. On Instagram the forthcoming editorial plans focus on visual storytelling to introduce the project, sharing the impact and reflecting the project's progress.  
A Youtube channel has been created for the project

(\url{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYQjjFQsooc45JqqfXHJiPCyN2wz9NhUp}). 

It currently contains the videos of the facilities.  Other videos, including short interviews, will be added in the near future.

EURO-LABS has established its presence on LinkedIn, focusing on professional networking and engagement with the scientific community. Regularly posts update on facilities videos, project news, milestones and upcoming events are made. The account connects with researchers, institutions, and industry professionals to foster collaboration. At present, the LinkedIn page has 38 followers but we expect to significantly increase this number as we will start to disseminate the QR code to the people regulating social media at the various  facilities.  The image in Fig.~\ref{fig:WP5-1a} displays a line graph titled "Metrics" with a green button labeled "Impressions." The x-axis represents dates, while the y-axis shows the number of impressions. The graph indicates fluctuations in impressions over time, with notable peaks around March 9 and March 14.
The image  in Fig.~\ref{fig:WP5-1b} displays a line graph titled "Metrics," focusing on the "Engagement rate." The x-axis represents dates, while the y-axis measures engagement rates. The graph shows spikes in engagement on February 22, March 4, and March 9, with lower engagement levels on other dates.

    \label{fig:WP5-1b}
\end{figure}

On Instagram, EURO-LABS aims to reach a broader audience, including the general public, by leveraging the platform's fast-paced and interactive nature. The project frequently posts short, engaging updates on progress, events, and research highlights. It uses relevant hashtags to increase the visibility of tweets and reach a wider audience. During events, conferences, and workshops, EURO-LABS provides real-time updates. Interaction with followers through retweets, replies and likes helps foster a sense of community. At present, the Instagram page has 131 followers. 

The social media activities of EURO-LABS on LinkedIn and Instagram are contributing to the project's outreach and dissemination goals. By maintaining an active and engaging presence on these platforms, EURO-LABS will successfully increase its visibility, foster collaboration, and promote knowledge sharing. 





\subparagraph{Task 5.2: Open Science } \mbox{}
%\todo{Work In Progress}

Within WP5, the goal of the Task 5.2 is to provide new services to the users in order to achieve an improved and facilitated access to experimental datasets produced in Research Infrastructures. The services aims at improved FAIR data practices. This includes (1) a new data catalog (openNP), (2) an 
%authentification 
authentication and authorization (AAI) service and (3) a prototype of platform for data access.

During the reporting period, for the sub-tasks, the main results are :
\begin{itemize}
    \item  release of the specification document of the openNP catalog under MS35.
    \item the AAI service based on INDIGO-IAM was published online (https://iam-eurolabs.ijclab.in2p3.fr/) and is now being used by the Virtual Access platform Theo4Exp (Task 2.4,\textbf{and page XXX of this document}) to authenticate their users. To date, more than 250 users are registered and the tool is actually used for the authentication of various services (Theo4Exp (Task of EURO-LABS), Grafana monoriting services at GSI and GANIL). Promotion of the service to future users was achieved.
    \item Different data lake prototypes are being developed/tested, also in coordination with the EU ESCAPE Project and the PUNCH4NFDI (consortium of particle, astro-, astroparticle, hadron and nuclear physics, representing about 9.000 scientists with a Ph.D. in Germany) project. The results from these activities, combined with the other related efforts like AAI, will lead to a federated infrastructure concept that will be implemented in FAIR and other infrastructures.
    \item An advanced training school on data management was organized under EURO-LABS WP5.4 in collaboration with the German HGS-HIRe doctoral school in Nov 2024, see in Fig.~\ref{fig:Open_Science_school}    
   two photos taken during the school corresponding to some of the activities realised during this very successful school.  A Zenodo repository was created, lectures and hands-on material can be found at the webpage: https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/eurolabs-os-school/teaching/project-zero for the other material, links are on the slides. The material produced by the school attendees was also published on the Zenodo repository of the project.

In addition, under Task 5.2, the Data Management Plan of EURO-LABS was reviewed and updated (D5.8).

Digital objects (reports, deliverables, communications, ...) produced by the project can be found on the Zenodo repository of the project (\url{https://zenodo.org/communities/euro-labs}). 

\subparagraph{Task 5.3: Machine Learning} \mbox{} 
%(Month xx-yy)} 

%\todo{Work in Progress}

Within WP5, the Task 5.3 aims to develop Machine Learning (ML) methods to improve beam characteristics, transport efficiency, and reproducibility of accelerator tuning, which will reduce the beam preparation time and thus increase the available time for the experiments. Accelerator laboratories worldwide are exploring a large variety of techniques to achieve this aim, from classical optimization and Bayesian optimization (BO) to reinforcement learning. One part of this automation effort is to provide a framework that allows machine experts, operators, and users to solve certain, focused optimization problems and to make these solutions reusable in an operational context. We call this project the “Generic Optimization Framework and Frontend”, or GeOFF for short.  EURO-LABS finances one scientific staff
member at GSI for three years for deployment and implication of GeOFF for improved beam delivery at EURO-LABS facilities.

The main result of Task 5.3 in RP2 is the regular use of GeOFF at two facilities, CERN (Switzerland) and GSI (Germany). Its successful application to improve accelerator tuning at GSI has been demonstrated in several dedicated beam experiments. The beam loss of the injection into the SIS18 synchrotron has been reduced from 40$\%$ to 15$\%$ in about 15 minutes, where manual tuning can take up to 2 hours. GeOFF has also been successfully applied to the GSI Fragment Separator (FRS) for beam steering and focusing, see Figure~\ref{fig:wp5_frs}. In particular, the great flexibility of GeOFF, allowing the integration of new and legacy control systems, has significantly facilitated and accelerated the application of ML methods at GSI and earlier at CERN (P1).

The adaptation of GeOFF to a laser-driven particle accelerator
at CEA (France) has started in  November 2024. The majority of the work will be carried out, in collaboration with GSI and CERN, by the post-doctoral researcher financed by EURO-LABS at GSI. The first tests on the LPA-UHI100 facility (one of the facilities offering beam time in WP3) will start as soon as the final authorization to shoot full energy on target will be given by the ASN (French Nuclear Safety Authority)/CEA. 

\subparagraph{Task 5.4: Training} \mbox{}

%\todo{Briefly explain the progress of the %task in context to the DoA.}
Within WP5, Task 5.4 aims to assure and improve the engagement of the new generation of scientists by the yearly organization of basic and advanced training schools, hosted by different beneficiary institutions of EURO-LABS, as well as the identification and partial support of other training events that are organized in Europe, in order not to duplicate efforts. We have proposed  in this project to have four Basic Training School (BTS) and four Advanced Training School (ATS), and in addition to support events organized by EURO-LABS beneficiaries, that fit the scope of our training aims within Task 5.4. In this way we concentrate in school covering aspects that are not present in the already existing training schools, for instance we put emphasis in training technical personnel although not only them.
So far we have organised two basic schools: BTS23 in September 13$^{th}$–23$^{rd}$, 2023, at IFIN-HH, Bucharest-Magurele, Romania ((https://indico.nipne.ro/event/246/) and BTS24 in June 18$^{th}$-27$^{th}$ 2024, in Warsaw, Poland (https://www.slcj.uw.edu.pl/en/bts24/), hosted by HIL and ICST, and two advanced schools: ATSOA (Advanced training School on Operation of Accelerators in June 3$^{rd}$ -7$^{th}$, 2024, at CERN (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1357293/) and Advanced School on Open Science and Data Management in November 24$^{th}$-27$^{th}$, 2024, at castle Ebernburgin Bad Kreuznach, Germany , (https://indico.gsi.de/event/19808/). All information about the  schools can be reached from the EURO-LABS web site. The details are also included in the deliverable D5.5 "Report on activities after 2 years, including follow-up from participants" (August 31, 2024) except for the Advanced School on Open Science and Data Management which hands-on material can be found at https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/eurolabs-os-school/teaching/project-zero, for the other material, links are in the slides. These schools were oversubscribed and had students from various parts of the World.  The training Scientific Board (TSB) selected in the first months of the project was involved in the selection of the candidates and in the program for theses hands-on schools. All the organized schools were well attended by students and young researchers from Europe and other continents and were very much appreciated. The Fig.~\ref{fig:ATSOA24} shows two photos taken during the ATSOA 2024 school at CERN. The one on the left during a hands-on work done by one of the subgroups and the other taken during one of the introductory lessons. The hosts asked the participants to answer questions and provide a feedback,  
%that were later used
to be used later to improve the organization of the next events. These are given in MS16

\end{figure}


Additionally, EURO-LABS has supported (co-sponsored) the “AZURE2-R-matrix school” in Edinburgh, June  23$^{th}$–28$^{th}$ 2024, and the Nuclear Physics for Astrophysics NPA XI school in Dresden, Sep. 9-15, 2024. In its latest meeting, the TSB has approved the organization of the remaining two BTS schools at CNA Seville in June 2025 and IFIN-HH in May 2026. TSB reviewed further requests for support (co-sponsorship), from The NIC XVIII school (Barcelona, June 2025), La Rabida School 25 (June 2025) and the Carpathian Summer School of Physics (Sinaia, June 2025). The three requests were accepted and the events are now being organized.


%Currently we are working on the new edition
We are currently engaged in the organization of the new edition 
of the advanced school in accelerators, ATSOA25, that will take place in May 12$^{th}$-16$^{th}$ at CERN. 
%32 applications were received and 
21 trainees were selected among 32 applications. %The basic School on Accelerator Applications, BTS25, will take place in Seville from 3rd to 9th of June[https://indico.cern.ch/event/1482911/]. The period for application close March 3rd.

All events organized or supported so far were very successful, based on the number of applicants and the positive feedback of the participants (already described in MS16). The organizers and trainers also learned
%have seen 
how these events can be even better organized and planned, to further increase the impact and attractiveness for the youngsters.
Below are some of the main feedback received:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hands-on events are the most appreciated by the trainees;
\item Diversity of equipment and installations used was well appreciated by those who are at the point of choosing a career path for their upcoming careers;
\item Basic Schools lasting 10-12 days allow the trainees to work directly, to know each-other 
and form longer term relationship for future strong scientific collaboration and on the personal level friendships.
\item The younger scientists were the most appreciated trainers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Main Results and Achievements}

%\todo{Briefly summarise the main results and achievements of the WP in context of the DoA.}
The main results of WP5 in RP2 correspond to the achieved deliverables: the videos of the facilities were completed and EURO-LABS activities on social media platforms have started; concerning open data, different data lake prototypes are being developed/tested; 
the new GeOFF toolkit, based on Machine Learning techniques was deployed at two facilities (GSI and CERN) and used for beam optimization. Finally, under Task 5.4 (Training), after the selection of the Training Scientific Board (TSB) was completed (by Feb. 2023), the training  activities were aligned with the EURO-LABS purposes %initial proposal 
and overseen by the TSB. Basic Training Schools (BTS) and Advanced Training Schools on Operation of Accelerators (ATSOA) were organized:

BTS23 at IFIN-HH, Bucharest-Magurele, Romania

BTS24, at HIL and INC, Warsaw, Poland

ATSOA24 at CERN, Geneve, Switzerland / France

ATSOSDM24 at GSI/FAIR, Darmstadt, Germany

For 2025 we are preparing
(organization in progress)
ATSOA25, at CERN in May, and
BTS25 in Seville, Spain in June.

Two schools were co-sponsored in 2024 and three more were approved for co-sponsorship in 2025.

\subsubsection*{Deviations and Corrective Actions}
\label{sec:wp5_deviations}
%\todo{Briefly summarize any deviations and performed corrective actions of the WP in context of the DoA.}
There were no deviations. The attendance of the schools went well beyond Europe.
%When confronted with 
Concerning applications from students from other continents (America, Africa), for which 
%we feared we will not have 
no sufficient funds were in principle available, %we have learned 
it was found 
that the applicants could come with travel support from their home institutions. That enlarged the reach of the events and of EURO-LABS to the international communities. 
%We have also learned 
It was also possible to notice that the joint extracurricular activities strongly bond the young participants and their hosts.
%One could also see 
%that common extra-curricula activities bind %very much the young participants and their %hosts.
\subsubsection*{Milestones and Deliverables}
In the RP2 reporting period, WP5 had 4 deliverables to submit which have been completed.
