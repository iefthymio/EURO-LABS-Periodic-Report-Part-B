\tsubsubsection{Trans-national access (TA) activities}

\subparagraph{Description of the publicity concerning the new opportunities for access} \mbox{}

Transnational Access offered by EURO-LABS for all facilities is advertised on the EURO-LABS website, where the potential users can find all the information on how to apply. In additon, in the WP2.5.1 Streamlined Access subtask, the offer of facilities providing beam for nuclear physics research within the WP2 package is presented in a more uniform and detailed way  through the website (still under construction) \url{https://www.slcj.uw.edu.pl/en/tna-euro-labs/}. 
Thanks to an effort done by WP5, this Web page includes an instructive video clips for all the facilities, giving an overview of their installations, key aspects and capabilities for the users.
Further publicity measures on the TA opportunities by EURO-LABS include:
i) advertisement on the main Web page of the facilities from all partners,
- mention EURO-LABS TAs in international conferences or workshops when a facility staff is giving a presentation or poster,
ii) request the users who received TA support by EURO-LABS to acknowledge and advertise the project when participating in International Conferences or Workshops in their slides or posters. This beyond their obligation to acknowledge the project in their publications (see Part A for the full list of publications in P2).

Details on specific publicity actions from selected facilities, are given below.

\textbf{GANIL}: For each call for proposals, the information is posted on the GANIL web page. The TA GANIL link is visible, and all opportunities, eligibilities and processes are described (\url{https://www.ganil-spiral2.eu/scientists/running-an-experiment-in-ganil/tna-ensar-support/}).

\textbf{GSI-FAIR}: All information on TA to GSI and FAIR through the EURO-LABS program is published in a website
(\url{https://www.gsi.de/work/organisation/wissenschaftliche_gremien/user/funding/euro-labs}).

\textbf{ISOLDE}: Several measures taken to publicize the opportunities offered by EURO-LABS. A dedicated web site: \url{https://isolde.web.cern.ch/index.php/euro-labs-financial-support} os available and includes information and guidelines like: who can apply, how to apply, call for proposals, financial support, application form, open access and open data obligations, structure and services of the research infrastructure. The group leaders of scheduled TA projects are informed via email, and the user community is informed at the annual user meeting. International workshops/conferences are used to inform a wider scientific community and national representatives informed regularly at collaboration meetings and expected to inform their communities. Last the EURO-LABS TA program is advertised in the ISOLDE yearly newsletter.

\textbf{IFIN-HH TANDEM}: The EURO-LABS support is publicized through a dedicated section of the IFIN-HH users office website (\url{https://useroffice.nipne.ro/}). The website describes the eligibility criteria and the steps to apply for support.

\textbf{INFN-LNL/LNS}: Calls for proposals are posted on the LNL (\url{https://www.lnl.infn.it/en/eurolabs-financial-support/}) and LNS web pages. The TA information is available, along with information on eligibility conditions, description on how to apply, Open Access and Open Data Obligations and instructions on how to acknowledge the support of EURO-LABS in publications. Annual reports are published yearly to inform the community.

\textbf{NLC-SLCJ}: In the webpage of the falicity \url{https://www.slcj.uw.edu.pl/en/euro-labs-transnational-access-to-the-heavy-ion-laboratory/} all the information concerning the access are described. There are two calls for proposals per year.

\textbf{NLC-CCB}:In the IFJ-PAN webpage \url{https://experimentsccb.ifj.edu.pl/}, a call for proposal is posted once a year, where all information concerning the TA and EURO-LABS support is described.

\textbf{ALTO}: Calls for proposals are posted on the ALTO web site \url{https://alto.ijclab.in2p3.fr/beam-time-access/} the EURO-LABS TA opportunity is highly visible, and the eligibility conditions are explained, along with a description on how to apply for access.

\textbf{JYU}: There are two calls per year for proposals to the JYFL-ACCLAB Program Advisory Committee (PAC), with fixed deadlines of 15th March and 15th September. These deadlines are reasonably well-known within the user community but are also advertised in advance via mailing lists and permanently on the facility website, along with instructions of how to apply for access and EURO-LABS support (\url{https://www.jyu.fi/accelerator/}).

\textbf{CLEAR (CNA - ATOMKI - IST)}: The access to CLEAR facilities is described in the webpage \url{https://institucional.us.es/clear/}, where the three facilities (IST, ATOMKI and CNA) are described. There are 3 calls a year, which are advertised in advance through the usual channels of the nuclear physics communities.

\textbf{KIT/FLUTE-KARA}: At each conference in which we present an overview of our accelerator facilities ALFA = KARA and FLUTE, KIT draws attention to the Transnational Access (TA) offer as part of the EU funding in the EURO-LABS project. On KIT websites implementation of the marketing for Transnational Access (TA) promised in the EURO-LABS application with partial funding within the framework of the EU project EURO-LABS on our following Internet pages: \url{https://www.ibpt.kit.edu/alfa.php}, among the films that were (partially) funded by EURO-LABS, and
\url{https://www.ibpt.kit.edu/user.php}, under the 4 points on ‘Proposal Submission System


\subparagraph{Description of the selection procedure}\mbox{}

The selection structures and procedures across all WPs have been established in alignment with the descriptions provided in the DoA. These structures and procedures vary significantly based on the type, scope, and size of the research facilities, coupled with local constraints related to beam authorization and planning at each facility. Detailed information for each WP is provided below:

\textbf{WP2}: The RIs in WP2 have individual USPs (cf. Table~\ref{tab:usp-wp2}), whose composition complies with the indications given in the GA. As a common rule to all facilities, all approved experiments that fulfill the TA eligibility criteria are funded. The level of funding is in general in proportion to the number of hours of access to the facility assigned to the particular research group by the Program Advisory Committee (PAC) / International Advisory Committee (IAC), but new users are favored, and young researchers and others with limited abilities are given priority with respect to established researchers, to secure their own funding for pursuing a research program at EURO-LABS RIs. While all projects that requested funding received some support, the available funds mean that not all individuals asking for funding could be supported. The frequency of the USP meetings (cf. Table~\ref{tab:usp-wp2-meet}) varies from 1 to 3 per year, and depends on the frequency od the Calls for Proposals and/or on scheduling of given experiments. The USP meetings take place either in person, by Zoom, or in a hybrid mode. Sometimes additional decisions are taken via email exchange (cf. Table~\ref{tab:usp-wp2-meet} for details).

\textbf{WP3}: A User Selection Panel (USP) is set up for each Task as described in the GA. The USPs were established in P1 (see Table~\ref{tab:usp-wp3}) and continued to operate throughout P2. The frequency of the USP meetings (see Table~\ref{tab:usp-wp3-meet}) varied, ranging from a few per year, depending on the volume of TA requests from the facilities, and moderated by the Task Leaders.

\tsubsubsection{Virtual access (VA) activities}



The \textbf{Theo4Exp} VA facility consists of 3 installations: \textbf{MeanField4Exp} in IFJ PAN Krakow, \textbf{Reaction4Exp} in USE Sevilla, and \textbf{Structure4Exp} in U. Milano. The users can access any of the 3 installations via a common entry point \url{https://institucional.us.es/theo4exp/}. In the 2nd Reporting Period 1915 AU (counted as each started hour of active use of the virtual service) were provided to 185 users (see Fig.~\ref{fig:WP2_VA_statistics}) from 21 countries worldwide (see Fig.~\ref{fig:VA_countries}).

    \caption{Geographical distribution of Theo4Exp VA installations users during P2.}
    \label{fig:VA_countries}
\end{figure}
The following activities were carried out in P2 in the 3 installations:

In IFJ-PAN \textbf{MeanField4Exp}: A computer scientist, who was hired on 1 February 2023 for a period of 2 years, has worked on preparation of the installation website (\url{https://meanfield4exp.ifj.edu.pl/}).Several advanced nuclear structure theory computer programs developed earlier were adapted to the processors available in KraKow. In parallel, the interactive software allowing communication between external logged-in users and our VA infrastructure was tested. The whole system allows interactive communication with the computer programs as well as access to pre-calculated data sets according to user demand, with numerical results transferred in a professional output format (usually diagrams ready for publication). External users can select among the following options:

1. Calculation of single-nucleon energies as functions of nuclear deformation constructed within the mean-field-theory approach based on the effective universal Hamiltonian, which depends on 12 parameters (6 for the protons and 6 for the neutrons) and provides a realistic, experiment-tested description of the single-nucleon spectra of all, nearly 3000 nuclei of the nuclear chart. The user can select the deformation-axis range and its multipolarity, as well as the standard Nilsson labeling of the curves, adapted to the publication standards.

2. Comparison of total nuclear potential energies calculated according to another literature standard, the Macroscopic-Microscopic Method (MMM). The user can plot several curves representing a selection of isotopes or isotones and allowing for a direct comparison of shape coexistence and competition within each nucleus. Both this and the previous option profit from the Inverse-Problem Theory, a branch of applied mathematics used to optimise the mean-field Hamiltonian.

3. Potential energy surfaces (2D maps) with user-chosen coordinate frames composed of multipole deformations ($a_{mn}$, $a_{m’n’}$). The default selection corresponds to the famous ($\beta$, $\gamma$)-shape parametrisation of Bohr, but numerous other choices are possible. This service is particularly well suited for identifying and examining nuclear shape competition, especially when interpreting experimental results.

4. Shape evolution with angular momentum based on macroscopic total nuclear energy surfaces especially adapted for the high-temperature description of shape evolution with spin. This option is practical and helpful for all those addressing shape transformations such as Jacobi and/or Poincare shape transitions, especially those relevant to nuclear giant dipole resonances.

5. Single-nucleon energies depending on nuclear frequency of rotation (cranking frequency), which helps the interpretation of results in terms of nuclear rotational properties within the so-called nuclear Cranking Model. Nearly completed extensions will allow the user to construct nuclear alignment plots as well as nuclear kinematic and dynamic moments. 

6. A graphical option to plot the shapes of nuclear surfaces (nuclear shapes) for a selected nuclear deformation.  By specifying the name of the point-group symmetry for the illustration of interest, two options allow the user to communicate with our system in terms of either the deformation multipolarities {$a_{mn}$} or the language of molecular symmetries.

These options will soon be supplemented by the possibilities of plotting a 3D representations of the nucleonic wave functions and of calculating reduced transition probabilities and lifetimes for both electric and magnetic transitions, which is particularly useful for the interpretation of the results of complex experiments. 
The installation has been visited by 50 different scientists worldwide. One publication in EPJA (\url{https://doi.org/10.1140/epja/s10050-024-01401-8}) contains a figure created using the Virtual Access facility MeanField4Exp.

In USE Sevilla \textbf{Reaction4Exp}: A computer scientist, who was hired on 11 September 2023 for a period of 2 years, has worked on the preparation of the main website (\url{https://institucional.us.es/theo4exp}) and  created the Reaction4Exp website (\url{https://reaction4exp.us.es}). In the main website she has included detailed information, photos, etc. The Reaction4Exp website includes the application for user access to the following calculations:

1. Coulomb breakup using the Equivalent Photon Model (EPM). The EPM code (developed by J.A. Lay Valera at University of Seville) calculates differential Coulomb breakup cross sections from external transition probabilities, as a function of both angle and energy. Multipolarities included are dipole and quadrupole for electric transitions and only dipole for magnetic transitions.

2. Elastic scattering using the Optical Model (OM). The OM calculation provides the angular distribution for the elastic scattering cross section of the reaction considered, at a given energy in the laboratory frame, if an optical potential is provided in order to describe the interaction between projectile and target. A classical calculation is also available (using a code developed by M. Gómez Ramos at University of Seville).

3. Inelastic scattering using the coupled-channel (CC) method and the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA). Results include the angular distribution for the cross section to each excited state and total reaction cross sections. 

4. Transfer reactions in DWBA. Defining the different partitions, the application provides the angular distribution for the transfer cross section from one partition to another, in which one particle is transferred from the projectile to the target or vice versa.
The code used for elastic, inelastic and transfer reactions is FRESCO, developed by I. J. Thompson, a close collaborator of the group at the University of Seville currently based at LLNL, USA.

The installation has been already used in various Master courses on nuclear reactions: Inter-university Master on Nuclear Reactions (Madrid, Barcelona, Granada, Salamanca and Sevilla), Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree on Nuclear Physics (Spain, France and Italy), and Master on Nuclear Structure and Astrophysics (Santiago de Compostela, Spain). It was visited by 81 different users worldwide.

In UMIL \textbf{Structure4Exp}: The person in charge of building the VA facility (\url{https://ns4exp.mi.infn.it/} was contracted between March 2023 and February 2024, with a partial overlap with the period under report. She has finished to implement and test the VA facility, which opened to the public before she left.  The installation hosted at the University of Milano offers two types of codes:

1. The first category includes codes for the calculation of basic spectroscopic properties of spherical nuclei throughout the mass table. Ground-state properties like masses and radii, as well as vibrational excited states, are provided. For each excited state, the codes give the transition strengths associated with isoscalar, isovector and electromagnetic operators. One can visualise how this strength is distributed among giant resonances and low-lying vibrational states. The two codes are self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) plus Random Phase Approximation (RPA), suitable for double-magic nuclei, or for nuclei with closed subshells both for neutrons and protons. The other code is based on HF+Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (HF+BCS) plus Quasiparticle RPA (QRPA), and can be used for spherical, open-shell systems. Both codes employ a Skyrme-type effective forces.

2. The second type of code is the shell-model code KSHELL. This has been developed by N. Shimizu and collaborators at the Centre for Computational Sciences of the University of Tsukuba and its implementation has benefited from the help of Giovanni Di Gregorio (Caserta University and INFN Napoli) and Angela Gargano (INFN Napoli). Calculations can be performed in different valence spaces, with a selection of appropriate interactions. Users can specify the energy levels to be determined, and the program provides energy, occupation numbers, main contributing configurations, and, if requested, E2 and M1 electromagnetic transition values. 

The installation has been visited by 54 different scientists worldwide  and it is envisioned to be used, partly, for a MSc course at the University of Milano.
